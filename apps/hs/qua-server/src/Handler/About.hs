                      The project is developed within our chair at ETH Zurich.

                      of urban systems for a sustainable future”

                      Qua-kit is a web platform for viewing and manipulating simple urban geometry. #
                    <p>
                      Logged in via edX platform you can work on a single design problem, #
                      share your ideas together with design proposals, view and discuss works of others.
                    <p>
                      Local clients can use qua-kit as a presentation tool.
                      Connected to a computational server backend #
                      it can use registered remote services for visual analysis of geometry.
                    <p>
                      The platform is an open source project; #
                      therefore, everyone is welcome to contribute.

                      One of this platform's goals is to gather data for ADvISE research project.
                    <p>
                      ADvISE stands for #
                       Data Analysis for understanding the Impact of urban design on Social pErformance of a city.
                    <p>
                      We aim to produce an open framework with basic functionality #
                      to efficiently search for compromise solutions for complex planning problems #
                      and an experimental software prototype #
                      with an intuitive user interface for representing planning problems #
                      and presenting optimal solutions at various stages of the design process.

                      Our first case study for the online course on edX platform is provided by Urban-ThinkTank group at ETH Zurich.
                    <p>
                      Empower Shack is an interdisciplinary development project directed by U-TT, #
                      ETH Zurich and the local NGO Ikhayalami Development Services, in collaboration with the BT-Section #
                      community and associated local and international partners.
                    <p>
                      The ongoing pilot phase is focused on a cluster of 68 houses within the BT-Section of Khayelitsha. #
                      Through innovative design and organisational models, the project aims to develop a comprehensive and #
                      sustainable informal settlement upgrading strategy centred on four core components: a two-story housing prototype, #
                      participatory spatial planning, ecological landscape management, and integrated livelihoods programming.
